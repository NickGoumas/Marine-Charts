There are two forms of electronic charts available for download, RNC and ENC, Rastor Navigational Chart and Electronic Navigational Chart respectively. The ENC file will have a file extention of ".000" along with some text files. The RNC file will consist of ".KAP" files with ".BSB" files to translate and rotate the image to the correct projection.

OceanServer's VectorMap v8.0 mission planning software seems to open either of these filetypes.

QGIS v2.18.14 will open the ENC vector file as a vector layer.
